### What's New in This Release

#### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.2 release consists of the following HIP enhancements:

##### HIP Installation Guide Updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include building HIP tests from source on the AMD and NVIDIA platforms.

For more details, refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.2.

##### Support for device-side malloc on HIP-Clang

HIP-Clang now supports device-side malloc. This implementation does not require the use of `hipDeviceSetLimit(hipLimitMallocHeapSize,value)` nor respect any setting. The heap is fully dynamic and can grow until the available free memory on the device is consumed.

The test codes at the following link show how to implement applications using malloc and free functions in device kernels:

<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/blob/develop/tests/src/deviceLib/hipDeviceMalloc.cpp>

For more information, refer to the HIP API documentation at <https://docs.amd.com/bundle/HIP_API_Guide/page/modules.html>

##### Planned HIP Changes in Future Releases

Changes to `hipDeviceProp_t`, `HIPMEMCPY_3D`, and `hipArray` structures (and related HIP APIs) are planned in the next major release. These changes may impact backward compatibility.

Refer to the Release Notes document in subsequent releases for more information.
ROCm Math and Communication Libraries

In this release, ROCm Math and Communication Libraries consist of the following enhancements and fixes:
New rocWMMA for Matrix Multiplication and Accumulation Operations Acceleration

This release introduces a new ROCm C++ library for accelerating mixed precision matrix multiplication and accumulation (MFMA) operations leveraging specialized GPU matrix cores. rocWMMA provides a C++ API to facilitate breaking down matrix multiply accumulate problems into fragments and using them in block-wise operations that are distributed in parallel across GPU wavefronts. The API is a header library of GPU device code, meaning matrix core acceleration may be compiled directly into your kernel device code. This can benefit from compiler optimization in the generation of kernel assembly and does not incur additional overhead costs of linking to external runtime libraries or having to launch separate kernels.

rocWMMA is released as a header library and includes test and sample projects to validate and illustrate example usages of the C++ API. GEMM matrix multiplication is used as primary validation given the heavy precedent for the library. However, the usage portfolio is growing significantly and demonstrates different ways rocWMMA may be consumed.

For more information, refer to <https://docs.amd.com/category/libraries>.

#### OpenMP Enhancements in This Release

##### OMPT Target Support

The OpenMP runtime in ROCm implements a subset of the OMPT device APIs, as described in the OpenMP specification document. These are APIs that allow first-party tools to examine the profile and traces for kernels that execute on a device. A tool may register callbacks for data transfer and kernel dispatch entry points. A tool may use APIs to start and stop tracing for device-related activities such as data transfer and kernel dispatch timings and associated metadata. If device tracing is enabled, trace records for device activities are collected during program execution and returned to the tool using the APIs described in the specification.

Following is an example demonstrating how a tool would use the OMPT target APIs supported. The README in /opt/rocm/llvm/examples/tools/ompt outlines the steps to follow, and you can run the provided example as indicated below:

```sh
cd /opt/rocm/llvm/examples/tools/ompt/veccopy-ompt-target-tracing
make run
```

The file `veccopy-ompt-target-tracing.c` simulates how a tool would initiate device activity tracing. The file `callbacks.h` shows the callbacks that may be registered and implemented by the tool.

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation filesystem hierarchy standard in this release to ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While moving to a new filesystem hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or older filesystem hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new filesystem hierarchy and backward compatibility.

##### New Filesystem Hierarchy

The following is the new filesystem hierarchy:

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake
    | --share
        | --html/<component>/*.html
        | --info/<component>/*.[pdf, md, txt]
        | --man
        | --doc
            | --<component>
                | --<licenses>
        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major release.

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward Compatibility with Older Filesystems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.

##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the example below:

```h
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

- `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
- `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
- `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
- Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 May 12 10:45 cmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   24 May 10 23:32 libamdhip64.so -> ../../lib/libamdhip64.so
```

##### CMake Config files

All CMake configuration files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib/cmake/<component>` folder. For backward compatibility, the old CMake locations (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib/cmake`) consist of a soft link to the new CMake config.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/cmake/hip/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 42 May 10 23:32 hip-config.cmake -> ../../../../lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake
```

#### Planned deprecation of hip-rocclr and hip-base packages

In the ROCm v5.2 release, hip-rocclr and hip-base packages (Debian and RPM) are planned for deprecation and will be removed in a future release. hip-runtime-amd and hip-dev(el) will replace these packages respectively. Users of hip-rocclr must install two packages, hip-runtime-amd and hip-dev, to get the same set of packages installed by hip-rocclr previously.

Currently, both package names hip-rocclr (or) hip-runtime-amd and hip-base (or) hip-dev(el) are supported.
Deprecation of Integrated HIP Directed Tests

The integrated HIP directed tests, which are currently built by default, are deprecated in this release. The default building and execution support through CMake will be removed in future release.

### Known Issues

This section consists of known issues in this release.

#### Compiler Error on gfx1030 When Compiling at -O0

##### Issue

A compiler error occurs when using -O0 flag to compile code for gfx1030 that calls atomicAddNoRet, which is defined in amd_hip_atomic.h. The compiler generates an illegal instruction for gfx1030.

##### Workaround

The workaround is not to use the -O0 flag for this case. For higher optimization levels, the compiler does not generate an invalid instruction.

#### System Freeze Observed During CUDA Memtest Checkpoint

##### Issue

Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU) requires 20 MB of VRAM approximately to checkpoint and restore. The CRIU process may freeze if the maximum amount of available VRAM is allocated to checkpoint applications.

##### Workaround

To use CRIU to checkpoint and restore your application, limit the amount of VRAM the application uses to ensure at least 20 MB is available.

#### HPC test fails with the “HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_FAULT” error

##### Issue

The compiler may incorrectly compile a program that uses the `__shfl_sync(mask, value, srcLane)` function when the "value" parameter to the function is undefined along some path to the function. For most functions, uninitialized inputs cause undefined behavior, but the definition for `__shfl_sync` should allow for undefined values.

##### Workaround

The workaround is to initialize the parameters to `__shfl_sync`.

> **Note**
>
> When the `-Wall` compilation flag is used, the compiler generates a warning indicating the variable is initialized along some path.

Example:

```cpp
double res = 0.0; // Initialize the input to __shfl_sync.
if (lane == 0) {
  res = <some expression>
}
res = __shfl_sync(mask, res, 0);
```

#### Kernel produces incorrect result

##### Issue

In recent changes to Clang, insertion of the noundef attribute to all the function arguments has been enabled by default.

In the HIP kernel, variable var in shfl_sync may not be initialized, so LLVM IR treats it as undef.

So, the function argument that is potentially undef (because it is not intialized) has always been assumed to be noundef by LLVM IR (since Clang has inserted noundef attribute). This leads to ambiguous kernel execution.

##### Workaround

- Skip adding `noundef` attribute to functions tagged with convergent  attribute. Refer to <https://reviews.llvm.org/D124158> for more information.

- Introduce shuffle attribute and add it to `__shfl` like APIs at hip headers. Clang can skip adding noundef attribute, if it finds that argument is tagged with shuffle attribute. Refer to <https://reviews.llvm.org/D125378> for more information.

- Introduce clang builtin for `__shfl` to identify it and skip adding `noundef` attribute.

- Introduce `__builtin_freeze` to use on the relevant arguments in library wrappers. The library/header need to insert freezes on the relevant inputs.

#### Issue with Applications Triggering Oversubscription

There is a known issue with applications that trigger oversubscription. A hardware hang occurs when ROCgdb is used on AMD Instinct™ MI50 and MI100 systems.

This issue is under investigation and will be fixed in a future release.

## ROCm 5.1.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-blanks-blockquote -->
### What's New in This Release

#### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.1 release consists of the following HIP enhancements.

##### HIP Installation Guide Updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include installation and building HIP from source on the AMD and NVIDIA platforms.

Refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.1 for more details.

##### Support for HIP Graph

ROCm v5.1 extends support for HIP Graph.

##### Planned Changes for HIP in Future Releases

###### Separation of hiprtc (libhiprtc) library from hip runtime (amdhip64)

On ROCm/Linux, to maintain backward compatibility, the hipruntime library (amdhip64) will continue to include hiprtc symbols in future releases. The backward compatible support may be discontinued by removing hiprtc symbols from the hipruntime library (amdhip64) in the next major release.

###### hipDeviceProp_t Structure Enhancements

Changes to the hipDeviceProp_t structure in the next major release may result in backward incompatibility.  More details on these changes will be provided in subsequent releases.

#### ROCDebugger Enhancements

##### Multi-language Source Level Debugger

The compiler now generates a source-level variable and function argument debug information.

The accuracy is guaranteed if the compiler options `-g -O0` are used and apply only to HIP.

This enhancement enables ROCDebugger users to interact with the HIP source-level variables and function arguments.

> **Note**
>
> The newly-suggested compiler -g option must be used instead of the previously-suggested `-ggdb` option. Although the effect of these two options is currently equivalent, this is not guaranteed for the future and might get changed by the upstream LLVM community.

##### Machine Interface Lanes Support

ROCDebugger Machine Interface (MI) extends support to lanes. The following enhancements are made:

- Added a new -lane-info command, listing the current thread's lanes.

- The -thread-select command now supports a lane switch to switch to a specific lane of a thread:

  ```sh
  -thread-select -l LANE THREAD
  ```

- The =thread-selected notification gained a lane-id attribute. This enables the frontend to know which lane of the thread was selected.

- The *stopped asynchronous record gained lane-id and hit-lanes attributes.  The former indicates which lane is selected, and the latter indicates which lanes explain the stop.

- MI commands now accept a global --lane option, similar to the global --thread and --frame options.

- MI varobjs are now lane-aware.

For more information, refer to the ROC Debugger User Guide at <https://docs.amd.com>.

##### Enhanced - clone-inferior Command

The clone-inferior command now ensures that the TTY, CMD, ARGS, and AMDGPU PRECISE-MEMORY settings are copied from the original inferior to the new one.  All modifications to the environment variables done using the 'set environment' or 'unset environment' commands are also copied to the new inferior.

#### MIOpen Support for RDNA GPUs

This release includes support for AMD Radeon™ Pro W6800, in addition to other bug fixes and performance improvements as listed below:

- MIOpen now supports RDNA GPUs!! (via MIOpen PRs 973, 780, 764, 740, 739, 677, 660, 653, 493, 498)

- Fixed a correctness issue with ImplicitGemm algorithm

- Updated the performance data for new kernel versions

- Improved MIOpen build time by splitting large kernel header files

- Fixed an issue in reduction kernels for padded tensors

- Various other bug fixes and performance improvements

For more information, see <https://docs.amd.com/bundle/MIOpen_gh-pages/page/releasenotes.html>

#### Checkpoint Restore Support With CRIU

The new Checkpoint Restore in Userspace (CRIU) functionality is implemented to support AMD GPU and ROCm applications.

CRIU is a userspace tool to Checkpoint and Restore an application.

CRIU lacked the support for checkpoint restore applications that used device files such as a GPU. With this ROCm release, CRIU is enhanced with a new plugin to support AMD GPUs, which includes:

- Single and Multi GPU systems (Gfx9)

- Checkpoint / Restore on a different system

- Checkpoint / Restore inside a docker container

- PyTorch

- Tensorflow

- Using CRIU Image Streamer

For more information, refer to <https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/tree/criu-dev/plugins/amdgpu>

> **Note**
>
> The CRIU plugin (amdgpu_plugin) is merged upstream with the CRIU repository. The KFD kernel patches are also available upstream with the amd-staging-drm-next branch (public) and the ROCm 5.1 release branch.

> **Note**
>
> This is a Beta release of the Checkpoint and Restore functionality, and some features are not available in this release.

For more information, refer to the following websites:

- <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/criu/blob/amdgpu_plugin-03252022/Documentation/amdgpu_plugin.txt>

- <https://criu.org/Main_Page>

### Fixed Defects

The following defects are fixed in this release.

#### Driver Fails To Load after Installation

The issue with the driver failing to load after ROCm installation is now fixed.

The driver installs successfully, and the server reboots with working rocminfo and clinfo.

#### ROCDebugger Fixed Defects

##### Breakpoints in GPU kernel code Before Kernel Is Loaded

Previously, setting a breakpoint in device code by line number before the device code was loaded into the program resulted in ROCgdb incorrectly moving the breakpoint to the first following line that contains host code.

Now, the breakpoint is left pending.  When the GPU kernel gets loaded, the breakpoint resolves to a location in the kernel.

##### Registers Invalidated After Write

Previously, the stale just-written value was presented as a current value.

ROCgdb now invalidates the cached values of registers whose content might differ after being written.  For example, registers with read-only bits.

ROCgdb also invalidates all volatile registers when a volatile register is written.  For example, writing VCC invalidates the content of STATUS as STATUS.VCCZ may change.

##### Scheduler-locking and GPU Wavefronts

When scheduler-locking is in effect, new wavefronts created by a resumed thread, CPU, or GPU wavefront, are held in the halt state. For example, the "set scheduler-locking" command.

##### ROCDebugger Fails Before Completion of Kernel Execution

It was possible (although erroneous) for a debugger to load GPU code in memory, send it to the device, start executing a kernel on the device, and dispose of the original code before the kernel had finished execution.  If a breakpoint was hit after this point, the debugger failed with an internal error while trying to access the debug information.

This issue is now fixed by ensuring that the debugger keeps a local copy of the original code and debug information.

### Known Issues

#### Random Memory Access Fault Errors Observed While Running Math Libraries Unit Tests

**Issue:** Random memory access fault issues are observed while running Math libraries unit tests. This issue is encountered in ROCm v5.0, ROCm v5.0.1, and ROCm v5.0.2.

Note, the faults only occur in the SRIOV environment.

**Workaround:** Use SDMA to update the page table. The Guest set up steps are as follows:

```sh
sudo modprobe amdgpu vm_update_mode=0
```

To verify, use

**Guest:**

```sh
cat /sys/module/amdgpu/parameters/vm_update_mode 0
```

Where expectation is 0.

#### CU Masking Causes Application to Freeze

Using CU Masking results in an application freeze or runs exceptionally slowly. This issue is noticed only in the GFX10 suite of products. Note, this issue is observed only in GFX10 suite of products.

This issue is under active investigation at this time.

#### Failed Checkpoint in Docker Containers

A defect with Ubuntu images kernel-5.13-30-generic and kernel-5.13-35-generic with Overlay FS results in incorrect reporting of the mount ID.

This issue with Ubuntu causes CRIU checkpointing to fail in Docker containers.

As a workaround, use an older version of the kernel. For example, Ubuntu 5.11.0-46-generic.

#### Issue with Restoring Workloads Using Cooperative Groups Feature

Workloads that use the cooperative groups function to ensure all waves can be resident at the same time may fail to restore correctly.
This issue is under investigation and will be fixed in a future release.

#### Radeon Pro V620 and W6800 Workstation GPUs

##### No Support for ROCDebugger on SRIOV

ROCDebugger is not supported in the SRIOV environment on any GPU.

This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.

#### Random Error Messages in ROCm SMI for SR-IOV

Random error messages are generated by unsupported functions or commands.

This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.

#### rocPRIM 2.10.13

rocPRIM 2.10.13 for ROCm 5.1.0

##### Fixed

- Fixed radix sort int64_t bug introduced in [2.10.11]

##### Added

- Future value
- Added device partition_three_way to partition input to three output iterators based on two predicates

##### Changed

- The reduce/scan algorithm precision issues in the tests has been resolved for half types.

##### Known Issues

- device_segmented_radix_sort unit test failing for HIP on Windows

#### rocRAND 2.10.13

rocRAND 2.10.13 for ROCm 5.1.0

##### Added

- Generating a random sequence different sizes now produces the same sequence without gaps
  indepent of how many values are generated per call.
  - Only in the case of XORWOW, MRG32K3A, PHILOX4X32_10, SOBOL32 and SOBOL64
  - This only holds true if the size in each call is a divisor of the distributions
    `output_width` due to performance
  - Similarly the output pointer has to be aligned to `output_width * sizeof(output_type)`

##### Changed

- [hipRAND](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipRAND.git) split into a separate package
- Header file installation location changed to match other libraries.
  - Using the `rocrand.h` header file should now use `#include &lt;rocrand/rocrand.h&gt;`, rather than `#include &lt;rocrand/rocrand.h&gt;`
- rocRAND still includes hipRAND using a submodule
  - The rocRAND package also sets the provides field with hipRAND, so projects which require hipRAND can begin to specify it.

##### Fixed

- Fix offset behaviour for XORWOW, MRG32K3A and PHILOX4X32_10 generator, setting offset now
  correctly generates the same sequence starting from the offset.
  - Only uniform int and float will work as these can be generated with a single call to the generator

### Fixed Defects

The following defects are fixed in the ROCm v5.0.2 release.

#### Issue with hostcall Facility in HIP Runtime

In ROCm v5.0, when using the “assert()” call in a HIP kernel, the compiler may sometimes fail to emit kernel metadata related to the hostcall facility, which results in incomplete initialization of the hostcall facility in the HIP runtime. This can cause the HIP kernel to crash when it attempts to execute the “assert()” call.

The root cause was an incorrect check in the compiler to determine whether the hostcall facility is required by the kernel. This is fixed in the ROCm v5.0.2 release.

The resolution includes a compiler change, which emits the required metadata by default, unless the compiler can prove that the hostcall facility is not required by the kernel. This ensures that the “assert()” call never fails.

Note:
This fix may lead to breakage in some OpenMP offload use cases, which use print inside a target region and result in an abort in device code. The issue will be fixed in a future release.
Compatibility Matrix Updates to ROCm Deep Learning Guide

The compatibility matrix in the AMD Deep Learning Guide is updated for ROCm v5.0.2.

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### Refactor of HIPCC/HIPCONFIG

In prior ROCm releases, by default, the hipcc/hipconfig Perl scripts were used to identify and set target compiler options, target platform, compiler, and runtime appropriately.

In ROCm v5.0.1, hipcc.bin and hipconfig.bin have been added as the compiled binary implementations of the hipcc and hipconfig. These new binaries are currently a work-in-progress, considered, and marked as experimental. ROCm plans to fully transition to hipcc.bin and hipconfig.bin in the a future ROCm release. The existing hipcc and hipconfig Perl scripts are renamed to hipcc.pl and hipconfig.pl respectively. New top-level hipcc and hipconfig Perl scripts are created, which can switch between the Perl script or the compiled binary based on the environment variable HIPCC_USE_PERL_SCRIPT.

In ROCm 5.0.1, by default, this environment variable is set to use hipcc and hipconfig through the Perl scripts.

Subsequently, Perl scripts will no longer be available in ROCm in a future release.

### What's New in This Release

#### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.0 release consists of the following HIP enhancements.

##### HIP Installation Guide Updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include building HIP from source on the NVIDIA platform.

Refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.0 for more details.

##### Managed Memory Allocation

Managed memory, including the `__managed__` keyword, is now supported in the HIP combined host/device compilation. Through unified memory allocation, managed memory allows data to be shared and accessible to both the CPU and GPU using a single pointer. The allocation is managed by the AMD GPU driver using the Linux Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) mechanism. The user can call managed memory API hipMallocManaged to allocate a large chunk of HMM memory, execute kernels on a device, and fetch data between the host and device as needed.

> **Note**
>
> In a HIP application,  it is recommended to do a capability check before calling the managed memory APIs. For example,
>
> ```cpp
> int managed_memory = 0;
> HIPCHECK(hipDeviceGetAttribute(&managed_memory,
>   hipDeviceAttributeManagedMemory,p_gpuDevice));
> if (!managed_memory ) {
>   printf ("info: managed memory access not supported on the device %d\n Skipped\n", p_gpuDevice);
> }
> else {
>   HIPCHECK(hipSetDevice(p_gpuDevice));
>   HIPCHECK(hipMallocManaged(&Hmm, N * sizeof(T)));
> . . .
> }
> ```

> **Note**
>
> The managed memory capability check may not be necessary; however, if HMM is not supported, managed malloc will fall back to using system memory. Other managed memory API calls will, then, have

Refer to the HIP API documentation for more details on managed memory APIs.

For the application, see

<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/blob/rocm-4.5.x/tests/src/runtimeApi/memory/hipMallocManaged.cpp>

#### New Environment Variable

The following new environment variable is added in this release:

| Environment Variable | Value                 | Description |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT    | 0 or 1 (default is 0) | Some processors support more CUs than can reliably be used in a cooperative dispatch. Setting the environment variable HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT to 1 will cause ROCr to return the correct CU count for cooperative groups through the HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT attribute of hsa_agent_get_info(). Setting HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT to other values, or leaving it unset, will cause ROCr to return the same CU count for the attributes HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT and HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT. Future ROCm releases will make HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT=1 the default. |

### Breaking Changes

#### Runtime Breaking Change

Re-ordering of the enumerated type in hip_runtime_api.h to better match NV.  See below for the difference in enumerated types.

ROCm software will be affected if any of the defined enums listed below are used in the code.  Applications built with ROCm v5.0 enumerated types will work with a ROCm 4.5.2 driver. However, an undefined behavior error will occur with a ROCm v4.5.2 application that uses these enumerated types with a ROCm 5.0 runtime.

### Known Issues

#### Incorrect dGPU Behavior When Using AMDVBFlash Tool

The AMDVBFlash tool, used for flashing the VBIOS image to dGPU, does not communicate with the ROM Controller specifically when the driver is present. This is because the driver, as part of its runtime power management feature, puts the dGPU to a sleep state.

As a workaround, users can run amdgpu.runpm=0, which temporarily disables the runtime power management feature from the driver and dynamically changes some power control-related sysfs files.

#### Issue with START Timestamp in ROCProfiler

Users may encounter an issue with the enabled timestamp functionality for monitoring one or multiple counters. ROCProfiler outputs the following four timestamps for each kernel:

- Dispatch

- Start

- End

- Complete

##### Issue

This defect is related to the Start timestamp functionality, which incorrectly shows an earlier time than the Dispatch timestamp.

To reproduce the issue,

1. Enable timing using the --timestamp on flag.

2. Use the -i option with the input filename that contains the name of the counter(s) to monitor.

3. Run the program.

4. Check the output result file.

##### Current behavior

BeginNS is lower than DispatchNS, which is incorrect.

##### Expected behavior

The correct order is:

Dispatch < Start < End < Complete

Users cannot use ROCProfiler to measure the time spent on each kernel because of the incorrect timestamp with counter collection enabled.

##### Recommended Workaround

Users are recommended to collect kernel execution timestamps without monitoring counters, as follows:

1. ​Enable timing using the --timestamp on flag, and run the application.

2. Rerun the application using the -i option with the input filename that contains the name of the counter(s) to monitor, and save this to a different output file using the -o flag.

3. Check the output result file from step 1.

4. The order of timestamps correctly displays as:
  DispathNS < BeginNS < EndNS < CompleteNS

5. Users can find the values of the collected counters in the output file generated in step 2.

#### Radeon Pro V620 and W6800 Workstation GPUs

##### No Support for SMI and ROCDebugger on SRIOV

System Management Interface (SMI) and ROCDebugger are not supported in the SRIOV environment on any GPU. For more information, refer to the Systems Management Interface documentation.

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### ROCm Libraries Changes – Deprecations and Deprecation Removal

- The hipFFT.h header is now provided only by the hipFFT package.  Up to ROCm 5.0, users would get hipFFT.h in the rocFFT package too.

- The GlobalPairwiseAMG class is now entirely removed, users should use the PairwiseAMG class instead.

- The rocsparse_spmm signature in 5.0 was changed to match that of rocsparse_spmm_ex.  In 5.0, rocsparse_spmm_ex is still present, but deprecated. Signature diff for rocsparse_spmm

#### HIP API Deprecations and Warnings

##### Warning - Arithmetic Operators of HIP Complex and Vector Types

In this release, arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types are deprecated.

- As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP complex types, users can use arithmetic operators of `std::complex` types.

- As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP vector types, users can use the operators of the native clang vector type associated with the data member of HIP vector types.

During the deprecation, two macros `_HIP_ENABLE_COMPLEX_OPERATORS` and `_HIP_ENABLE_VECTOR_OPERATORS` are provided to allow users to conditionally enable arithmetic operators of HIP complex or vector types.

Note, the two macros are mutually exclusive and, by default, set to Off.

The arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types will be removed in a future release.

Refer to the HIP API Guide for more information.

#### Warning - Compiler-Generated Code Object Version 4 Deprecation

Support for loading compiler-generated code object version 4 will be deprecated in a future release with no release announcement and replaced with code object 5 as the default version.

The current default is code object version 4.

#### Warning - MIOpenTensile Deprecation

MIOpenTensile will be deprecated in a future release.

- The block sizes for device merge sorts initial block sort and its merge steps are now separate in its kernel config
    - the block sort step supports multiple items per thread

##### Changed

- size_limit for scan, reduce and transform can now be set in the config struct instead of a parameter
- Device_scan and device_segmented_scan: `inclusive_scan` now uses the input-type as accumulator-type, `exclusive_scan` uses initial-value-type.
  - This particularly changes behaviour of small-size input types with large-size output types (e.g. `short` input, `int` output).
  - And low-res input with high-res output (e.g. `float` input, `double` output)
- Revert old Fiji workaround, because they solved the issue at compiler side
- Update README cmake minimum version number
- Block sort support multiple items per thread
    - currently only powers of two block sizes, and items per threads are supported and only for full blocks
- Bumped the minimum required version of CMake to 3.16

##### Known Issues

- Unit tests may soft hang on MI200 when running in hipMallocManaged mode.
- device_segmented_radix_sort, device_scan unit tests failing for HIP on Windows
- ReduceEmptyInput cause random faulire with bfloat16

#### rocRAND 2.10.12

rocRAND 2.10.12 for ROCm 5.0.0

##### Changed

- No updates or changes for ROCm 5.0.0.

#### rocSOLVER 3.16.0

rocSOLVER 3.16.0 for ROCm 5.0.0

##### Added

- Symmetric matrix factorizations:
    - LASYF
    - SYTF2, SYTRF (with batched and strided\_batched versions)
- Added `rocsolver_get_version_string_size` to help with version string queries
- Added `rocblas_layer_mode_ex` and the ability to print kernel calls in the trace and profile logs
- Expanded batched and strided\_batched sample programs.

##### Optimized

- Improved general performance of LU factorization
- Increased parallelism of specialized kernels when compiling from source, reducing build times on multi-core systems.

##### Changed

- The rocsolver-test client now prints the rocSOLVER version used to run the tests,
  rather than the version used to build them
- The rocsolver-bench client now prints the rocSOLVER version used in the benchmark

##### Fixed

- Added missing stdint.h include to rocsolver.h

#### rocSPARSE 2.0.0

rocSPARSE 2.0.0 for ROCm 5.0.0

##### Added

- csrmv, coomv, ellmv, hybmv for (conjugate) transposed matrices
- csrmv for symmetric matrices

##### Changed

- spmm\_ex is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release

##### Improved

- Optimization for gtsv

#### rocThrust 2.13.0

rocThrust 2.13.0 for ROCm 5.0.0

##### Added

- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.13.0
- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.14.0
- Added async scan

##### Changed

- Scan algorithms: `inclusive_scan` now uses the input-type as accumulator-type, `exclusive_scan` uses initial-value-type.
    - This particularly changes behaviour of small-size input types with large-size output types (e.g. `short` input, `int` output).
    - And low-res input with high-res output (e.g. `float` input, `double` output)

#### Tensile 4.31.0

Tensile 4.31.0 for ROCm 5.0.0

##### Added

- DirectToLds support (x2/x4)
- DirectToVgpr support for DGEMM
- Parameter to control number of files kernels are merged into to better parallelize kernel compilation
- FP16 alternate implementation for HPA HGEMM on aldebaran

##### Optimized

- Add DGEMM NN custom kernel for HPL on aldebaran

##### Changed

- Update tensile_client executable to std=c++14

##### Removed

- Remove unused old Tensile client code

##### Fixed

- Fix hipErrorInvalidHandle during benchmarks
- Fix addrVgpr for atomic GSU
- Fix for Python 3.8: add case for Constant nodeType
- Fix architecture mapping for gfx1011 and gfx1012
- Fix PrintSolutionRejectionReason verbiage in KernelWriter.py
- Fix vgpr alignment problem when enabling flat buffer load
