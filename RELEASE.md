### Fixed Defects

#### Issue with rocTHRUST and rocPRIM Libraries

There was a known issue with rocTHRUST and rocPRIM libraries supporting iterator and types in ROCm v5.3.x releases.

- `thrust::merge` no longer correctly supports different iterator types for `keys_input1` and `keys_input2`.
- `rocprim::device_merge` no longer correctly supports using different types for `keys_input1` and `keys_input2`.

This issue is resolved with the following fixes to compilation failures:

- rocPRIM: in device_merge if the two key iterators do not match.
- rocTHRUST: in thrust::merge if the two key iterators do not match.
