The ROCm™ 6.1 release consists of new features and fixes to improve the stability and
performance of AMD Instinct™ MI300 GPU applications. Notably, we've added:

* Full support for Ubuntu 22.04.4.

* **rocDecode**, a new ROCm component that provides high-performance video decode support for
  AMD GPUs. With rocDecode, you can decode compressed video streams while keeping the resulting
  YUV frames in video memory. With decoded frames in video memory, you can run video
  post-processing using ROCm HIP, avoiding unnecessary data copies via the PCIe bus.

  To learn more, refer to the rocDecode 
  [documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocDecode/en/latest/).

### OS and GPU support changes

ROCm 6.1 adds the following operating system support:

* MI300A: Ubuntu 22.04.4 and RHEL 9.3
* MI300X: Ubuntu 22.04.4

Future releases will add additional operating systems to match our general offering. For older
generations of supported AMD Instinct products, we’ve added Ubuntu 22.04.4 support.

### Installation packages

This release includes a new set of packages for every module (all libraries and binaries default to
`DT_RPATH`). Package names have the suffix `rpath`; for example, the `rpath` variant of `rocminfo` is
`rocminfo-rpath`.

```{warning}
The new `rpath` packages will conflict with the default packages; they are meant to be used only in
environments where legacy `DT_RPATH` is the preferred form of linking (instead of `DT_RUNPATH`). We
do **not** recommend trying to install both sets of packages.
```
