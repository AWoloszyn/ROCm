#### HIPCC

HIPCC for ROCm 6.1.1

##### Changes

* ROCm 6.2 will enable compiled binaries `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` by default. No action is needed by the users; users can keep calling high level perl scripts `hipcc` and `hipconfig`; `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` will be invoked by high level perl scripts. To revert to previous behavior to invoke `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`, users must set the `HIP_USE_PERL_SCRIPTS` environment variable to 1
* ROCm 6.3 will remove high level perl scripts `hipcc` and `hipconfig`. It will remove the `HIP_USE_PERL_SCRIPTS` environment variable. It will rename `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` to `hipcc` and `hipconfig` respectively. No action is needed by the users. To revert to previous behavior, users need to invoke `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl` explicitly
* ROCm 7.0 will remove `hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`
